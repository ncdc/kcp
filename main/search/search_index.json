Since clusters are intended to be a single failure domain, by separating the desired state from any one \"real\" cluster we can potentially unlock better resiliency, simpler workload isolation, and allow workloads to move through the dev/stage/prod pipeline more cleanly. If we can keep familiar tools and APIs working, but separate the app just a bit from the cluster, that can help us move and react to failure more effectively.</p> <ul> <li>Virtualize some key user focused Kube APIs so that the control plane can delegate complexity to a target cluster</li> </ul> <p>The Kubernetes APIs layer on top of each other and compose loosely. Some concepts like <code>Deployments</code> are well suited for delegation because they are self-contained - the spec describes the goal and status summarizes whether the goal is reached. The same goes for a <code>PersistentVolumeClaim</code> - you ask for storage and it follows your pod around a cluster - you don't really care about the details. On the other hand, you definitely need to get <code>Pod</code> logs to debug problems, and <code>Services</code> have a lot of cluster specific meaning (like DNS and the cluster IP). To scale, we need to let the real clusters focus on keeping the workload running, and keep the control plane at a higher level, and that may require us to pretend to have pods on the control plane while actually delegating to the underlying cluster.</p> <ul> <li>Identify and invest in workload APIs and integrations that enable applications to spread across clusters transparently</li> </ul> <p>Multi-cluster workload scheduling and placement has a rich history within Kubernetes from the very beginning of the project, starting with Kubernetes federation v1.  Even today, projects like karmada are exploring how to take Kube APIs and make them work across multiple clusters. We want to amplify their ideas by improving the control plane itself - make it easy to plug in a workload orchestration system above Kube that still feels like Kube, without having a pesky cluster sitting around.</p> <p>See the investigations doc for transparent multi-cluster for    more.</p> <ul> <li>Use logical tenant clusters as the basis for application and security isolation</li> </ul> <p>Allow a single kube-apiserver to support multiple (up to 1000) logical clusters that can map/sync/schedule to zero or many physical clusters. Each logical cluster could be much more focused - only the resources needed to support a single application or team, but with the ability to scale to lots of applications. Because the logical clusters are served by the same server, we could amortize the cost of each individual cluster (things like RBAC, CRDs, and authentication can be shared / hierarchal).</p> <p>We took inspiration from the virtual cluster project within sig-multicluster as well as vcluster and other similar approaches that leverage cluster tenancy which led us to ask if we could make those clusters an order of magnitude cheaper by building within the kube-apiserver rather than running full copies. Most applications are small, which means amortizing costs can become a huge win. Single process sharing would let us embed significantly more powerful tenancy concepts like hierarchy across clusters, virtualizing key interfaces, and a much more resilient admission chain than what can be done in webhooks.</p> <p>See the investigations doc for logical clusters for more.</p> <p>Most importantly, if clusters are cheap, we can:</p> <ul> <li>Support stronger tenancy and isolation of CRDs and applications</li> </ul> <p>Lots of little clusters gives us the opportunity to improve how CRDs can be isolated (for development or individual teams), shared (one source for many consumers), and evolved (identify and flag incompatibilities between APIs provided by different clusters). A control plane above Kubernetes lets us separate the \"data plane\" of controllers/integrations from the infrastructure that runs them and allows for centralization of integrations. If you have higher level workloads, talking to higher level abstractions like cloud services, and the individual clusters are just a component, suddenly integrating new patterns and controls becomes more valuable. Conversely, if we have a control plane and a data plane, the types of integrations at each level can begin to differ. More powerful integrations to physical clusters might be run only by infrastructure operations teams, while application integrations could be safely namespaced within the control plane.</p> <p>Likewise, as we split up applications into smaller chunks, we can more carefully define their dependencies.  The account service from the identity team doesn't need to know the details of the frontend website or even where or how it runs. Instead, teams could have the freedom of their own personal clusters, with the extensions they need, without being able to access the details of their peer's except by explicit contract.</p> <p>If we can make extending Kubernetes more interesting by providing this higher level control plane, we likewise need to deal with the scalability of that extensibility:</p> <ul> <li>Make Kubernetes controllers more scalable and flexible on both the client and the server</li> </ul> <p>Subdividing one cluster into hundreds makes integrations harder - a controller would need to be able to access resources across all of those clusters (whether logical, virtual, or physical). For this model to work, we need to explore improvements to the Kubernetes API that would make multi-cluster controllers secure and easy. That involves ideas like watching multiple resources at the same time, listing or watching in bulk across lots of logical clusters, filtering server side, and better client tooling. Many of these improvements could also benefit single-cluster use cases and scalability.</p> <p>To go further, standardizing some of the multi-cluster concepts (whether scheduling, location, or resiliency) into widely used APIs could benefit everyone in the Kubernetes ecosystem, as we often end up building and rebuilding custom platform tooling. The best outcome would be small incremental improvements across the entire Kube ecosystem leading to increased reuse and a reduced need to invest in specific solutions, regardless of the level of the project.</p> <p>Finally, the bar is still high to writing controllers. Lowering the friction of automation and integration is in everyone's benefit - whether that's a bash script, a Terraform configuration, or custom SRE services.  If we can reduce the cost of both infrastructure as code and new infrastructure APIs we can potentially make operational investments more composable.</p> <p>See the investigations doc for minimal API server for more on    improving the composability of the Kube API server.</p> <ul> <li>Drive new workload APIs and explore standardization in the ecosystem</li> </ul> <p>There are hundreds of ways to build and run applications, and that will never change. The key success of Kubernetes was offering \"good enough\" standardized deployment, which created a center of gravity for the concepts around deployment. There are plenty of deployments that will never run in containers yet consume them daily. Aligning the deployment of multiple types of workloads from common CI/CD tooling at a higher level, as well as abstracting their dependencies, is something in widespread practice today.</p> <p>Beyond deployment, we could look at connections between these applications (networking, security, identity, access) and find ways to bridge the operational divide between cloud and cluster. That might include expanding existing APIs like <code>PersistentVolumeClaims</code> so your data can follow you across clusters or services. Or documenting a selection of choices for multi-cluster networking that simplify assumptions apps need to make. Or even ways of connecting cluster and cloud resources more directly via unified identity, service meshes, and proxies (all of which are hot topics in our ecosystem).</p>"},{"location":"GOALS/#process","title":"Process","text":"<p>Right now we are interested in assessing how these goals fit within the larger ecosystem.</p>"},{"location":"GOALS/#terminology","title":"Terminology","text":"<p>We've attempted to pick novel terms for concepts introduced here so as not to conflict or confuse existing projects, but if you do spot problems let us know.</p> <ul> <li>logical cluster - a cluster that looks and acts like a Kube cluster but is not served by kube-apiserver (as distinct from virtual clusters in the upstream which are instances of kube-apiserver).</li> <li>physical cluster - a cluster with nodes, a kube-apiserver or equivalent tied to the standard APIs.

Push works well in simple getting started scenarios and when the process is \"acting on behalf\" of a user. For example, <code>kcp</code> and the <code>cluster-controller</code> example in the demo can work in both the push model (talk to each cluster to grab CRDs and sync resources) and the pull model (run as a separate controller so that customized security rules could be in place).

It holds some state/data from that shard in memory and pushes it to the cache server. The controller uses standard informers for getting required resources both from a local kcp instance and remote cache server. Before pushing data it has to compare remote data to its local copy and make sure both copies are consistent.</p> <p>The second mode of operation is implemented as a read controller(s) that runs on some shard. It holds other shards' data in an in-memory cache using an informer, effectively pulling data from the central cache.

So in order to use a service account for accessing cross-workspace data (and that's what is necessary in example 2 and 3 at least), we need a virtual workspace to add the necessary authz.</p> <ul> <li>Are virtual workspaces read-only? No, they are not necessarily. Some are, some are not. The controller view virtual workspace will be writable, as well as the syncer virtual workspace.</li> <li>Do service teams have to write their own virtual workspace? Not for the standard cases as described above. There might be cases in the future where service teams provide their own virtual workspace for some very special purpose access patterns. But we are not there yet.</li> <li>Where does the developer get the URL from of the virtual workspace? The URLs will be \"published\" in some object status. E.g. APIExport.status will have a list of URLs that controllers have to connect to (example 2). Similarly, SyncTarget.status will have URLs for the syncer virtual workspaces, etc. We might do the same in WorkspaceType.status (example 3).</li> <li>Will there be multiple virtual workspace URLs my controller has to watch? Yes, as soon as we add sharding, it will become a list. So it might be that 1000 tenants are accessible under one URL, the next 1000 under another one, and so on. The controllers have to watch the mentioned URL lists in status of objects and start new instances (either with their own controller sharding eventually, or just in process with another go routine).</li> <li>Show me the code. The stock kcp virtual workspaces are in the package <code>pkg/virtual</code>.</li> <li>Who runs the virtual workspaces? The stock kcp virtual workspaces will be run through <code>kcp start</code> in-process. The personal workspace one (example 1) can also be run as its own process and the kcp apiserver will forward traffic to the external address. There might be reasons in the future like scalability that the later model is preferred. For the clients of virtual workspaces that has no impact.

The APIBindings referencing this APIExport will store a derived, non-sensitive value of this identity.  The identity of an APIExport cannot be changed. A derived, non-sensitive value of the identity key is stored in the APIExport status and this value is immutable.  The identity is defaulted. A secret with the name of the APIExport is automatically created.</p> object <p>secretRef is a reference to a secret that contains the API identity in the \u2018key\u2019 file.</p> string <p>name is unique within a namespace to reference a secret resource.</p> string <p>namespace defines the space within which the secret name must be unique.</p> array <p>latestResourceSchemas records the latest APIResourceSchemas that are exposed with this APIExport.  The schemas can be changed in the life-cycle of the APIExport. These changes have no effect on existing APIBindings, but only on newly bound ones.  For updating existing APIBindings, use an APIDeployment keeping bound workspaces up-to-date.</p> string object <p>maximalPermissionPolicy will allow for a service provider to set an upper bound on what is allowed for a consumer of this API. If the policy is not set, no upper bound is applied, i.e the consuming users can do whatever the user workspace allows the user to do.  The policy consists of RBAC (Cluster)Roles and (Cluster)Bindings. A request of a user in a workspace that binds to this APIExport via an APIBinding is additionally checked against these rules, with the user name and the groups prefixed with <code>apis.kcp.io:binding:</code>.  For example: assume a user <code>adam</code> with groups <code>system:authenticated</code> and <code>a-team</code> binds to this APIExport in another workspace root:org:ws. Then a request in that workspace against a resource of this APIExport is authorized as every other request in that workspace, but in addition the RBAC policy here in the APIExport workspace has to grant access to the user <code>apis.kcp.io:binding:adam</code> with the groups <code>apis.kcp.io:binding:system:authenticated</code> and <code>apis.kcp.io:binding:a-team</code>.</p> object <p>local is the policy that is defined in same workspace as the API Export.</p> array <p>permissionClaims make resources available in APIExport\u2019s virtual workspace that are not part of the actual APIExport resources.  PermissionClaims are optional and should be the least access necessary to complete the functions that the service provider needs. Access is asked for on a GroupResource + identity basis.  PermissionClaims must be accepted by the user\u2019s explicit acknowledgement. Hence, when claims change, the respecting objects are not visible immediately.  PermissionClaims overlapping with the APIExport resources are ignored.</p> object <p>PermissionClaim identifies an object by GR and identity hash. Its purpose is to determine the added permissions that a service provider may request and that a consumer may accept and allow the service provider access to.</p> boolean <p>all claims all resources for the given group/resource. This is mutually exclusive with resourceSelector.</p> string <p>group is the name of an API group. For core groups this is the empty string \u2018\u201c\u201d\u2019.</p> string <p>This is the identity for a given APIExport that the APIResourceSchema belongs to. The hash can be found on APIExport and APIResourceSchema\u2019s status. It will be empty for core types. Note that one must look this up for a particular KCP instance.</p> string Required <p>resource is the name of the resource. Note: it is worth noting that you can not ask for permissions for resource provided by a CRD not provided by an api export.</p> array <p>resourceSelector is a list of claimed resource selectors.</p> object string <p>name of an object within a claimed group/resource. It matches the metadata.name field of the underlying object. If namespace is unset, all objects matching that name will be claimed.</p> string <p>namespace containing the named object. Matches metadata.namespace field. If \u201cname\u201d is unset, all objects from the namespace are being claimed.</p> object <p>Status communicates the observed state.</p> array <p>conditions is a list of conditions that apply to the APIExport.</p> object <p>Condition defines an observation of a object operational state.</p> string Required <p>Last time the condition transitioned from one status to another. This should be when the underlying condition changed. If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.</p> string <p>A human readable message indicating details about the transition. This field may be empty.</p> string <p>The reason for the condition\u2019s last transition in CamelCase. The specific API may choose whether or not this field is considered a guaranteed API. This field may not be empty.</p> string <p>Severity provides an explicit classification of Reason code, so the users or machines can immediately understand the current situation and act accordingly. The Severity field MUST be set only when Status=False.</p> string Required <p>Status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.</p> string Required <p>Type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase. Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.</p> string <p>identityHash is the hash of the API identity key of this APIExport. This value is immutable as soon as it is set.</p> array <p>virtualWorkspaces contains all APIExport virtual workspace URLs.  Deprecated: use APIExportEndpointSlice.status.endpoints instead</p> object string Required <p>url is an APIExport virtual workspace URL.</p>"},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.apiVersion","title":".apiVersion","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.kind","title":".kind","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.metadata","title":".metadata","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.spec","title":".spec","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.spec.identity","title":".spec.identity","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.spec.identity.secretRef","title":".spec.identity.secretRef","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.spec.identity.secretRef.name","title":".spec.identity.secretRef.name","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.spec.identity.secretRef.namespace","title":".spec.identity.secretRef.namespace","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.spec.latestResourceSchemas","title":".spec.latestResourceSchemas","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.spec.latestResourceSchemas[*]","title":".spec.latestResourceSchemas[*]","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.spec.maximalPermissionPolicy","title":".spec.maximalPermissionPolicy","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.spec.maximalPermissionPolicy.local","title":".spec.maximalPermissionPolicy.local","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.spec.permissionClaims","title":".spec.permissionClaims","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.spec.permissionClaims[*]","title":".spec.permissionClaims[*]","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.spec.permissionClaims[*].all","title":".spec.permissionClaims[*].all","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.spec.permissionClaims[*].group","title":".spec.permissionClaims[*].group","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.spec.permissionClaims[*].identityHash","title":".spec.permissionClaims[*].identityHash","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.spec.permissionClaims[*].resource","title":".spec.permissionClaims[*].resource","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.spec.permissionClaims[*].resourceSelector","title":".spec.permissionClaims[*].resourceSelector","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.spec.permissionClaims[*].resourceSelector[*]","title":".spec.permissionClaims[*].resourceSelector[*]","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.spec.permissionClaims[*].resourceSelector[*].name","title":".spec.permissionClaims[*].resourceSelector[*].name","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.spec.permissionClaims[*].resourceSelector[*].namespace","title":".spec.permissionClaims[*].resourceSelector[*].namespace","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.status","title":".status","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.status.conditions","title":".status.conditions","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.status.conditions[*]","title":".status.conditions[*]","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.status.conditions[*].lastTransitionTime","title":".status.conditions[*].lastTransitionTime","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.status.conditions[*].message","title":".status.conditions[*].message","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.status.conditions[*].reason","title":".status.conditions[*].reason","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.status.conditions[*].severity","title":".status.conditions[*].severity","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.status.conditions[*].status","title":".status.conditions[*].status","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.status.conditions[*].type","title":".status.conditions[*].type","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.status.identityHash","title":".status.identityHash","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.status.virtualWorkspaces","title":".status.virtualWorkspaces","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.status.virtualWorkspaces[*]","title":".status.virtualWorkspaces[*]","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiexports.apis.kcp.io/#v1alpha1-.status.virtualWorkspaces[*].url","title":".status.virtualWorkspaces[*].url","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apiresourceimports.apiresource.kcp.io/","title":"APIResourceImport","text":""},{"location":"reference/crd/apires
